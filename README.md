# Backtesting Strategies

## Overview
This project focuses on backtesting trading strategies using technical indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index) and MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence).

## Technical Indicators

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA (Exponential Moving Average) from the 12-period EMA.

## Backtester
The backtester is a tool that allows you to test trading strategies against historical data to evaluate their performance. It helps in understanding how a strategy would have performed in the past and can be used to optimize and refine trading strategies.

## Email Notifications
The project includes a feature to send email notifications based on specific trading signals. This allows users to stay updated on important events without constantly monitoring the market.

### Usage
Once configured, the backtester will automatically send email notifications when predefined trading signals are triggered. This ensures that you never miss critical trading opportunities.
