Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate at Cornell University interested in geometry. I currently think about toric geometry and the algebro-geometric and symplectic invariants of these spaces. I am coadvised by Professor Allen Knutson and Professor Tara Holm. 

Here is my [CV](./ye-cv.pdf).

I enjoy traveling, lifting, running, biking, Chinese and Spanish language, and the great game of No Limit Texas Holdem. My favorite author is John Steinbeck. This is me at Semuc Champey, Guatemala in the winter of 2023.
