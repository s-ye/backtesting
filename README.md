# Songyu Ye (叶松瑜）

Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate at Cornell University interested in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. My research interests currently include moduli problems, geometric invariant theory, algebraic groups, representation theory, equivariant cohomology, equivariant K-theory, symplectic and algebraic quotients.
I previously participated in the University of Maryland REU in Combinatorics, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence (2021).

You can find the REU paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02745)
