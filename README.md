Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate at Cornell University interested in geometry. I currently think about toric geometry and the algebro-geometric and topological invariants of these spaces. I am mentored by Professors Allen Knutson (an algebraic geometer) and Tara Holm (a symplectic geometer), and these schools come together to put forth a rich story of the geometry of toric manifolds.

Recently I have developed a budding interest in the intersection of algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, and algebraic K-theory. In particular, I am very curious about applications of derived algebraic geometry and motivic homotopy theory to problems in enumerative geometry (both of the algebraic and symplectic flavor).

Here is my [CV](./ye-cv.pdf).

I enjoy traveling, Chinese language, biking, running, and recently rollerblading. My favorite author is John Steinbeck. I spent some time backpacking in Latin America in the winter of 2023. This is me at Semuc Champey, Guatemala.
