Hello! I'm a third year undergraduate at Cornell University. I'm interested in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology. I'm currently studying moduli spaces of pointed curves using geometric invariant theory, advised by Professor Daniel Halpern-Leistner. I previously participated in the University of Maryland REU in Combinatorics, Algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence (2021).
